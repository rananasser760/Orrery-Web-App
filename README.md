# 🌌 Interactive Orrery Web App

Welcome to the Interactive Orrery Web App, a project developed for the NASA Space Apps Challenge! This web application visualizes celestial bodies in our solar system, including planets, Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), Near-Earth Comets (NECs), and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs).

## 🚀 Overview

Inspired by the mechanical models presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, in 1713, our project transforms the traditional concept of orreries into a dynamic, interactive web experience. Users can explore the beauty of the cosmos by visualizing celestial movements and learning about the fascinating objects that share our solar neighborhood!

### Keplerian Orbits

Our orrery app utilizes Keplerian parameters to accurately simulate the orbits of celestial bodies. The key parameters include:

- **Eccentricity (e)**: Indicates the shape of the orbit; values range from 0 (circular) to 1 (parabolic).
- **Semi-Major Axis (a)**: The average distance from the celestial body to the center of mass (usually the Sun).
- **Inclination (i)**: The tilt of the orbit's plane relative to a reference plane (e.g., the ecliptic).
- **Argument of Periapsis (ω)**: The angle from the ascending node to the point of closest approach to the Sun.
- **True Anomaly (ν)**: The angle between the direction of periapsis and the current position of the body in its orbit.
- **Longitude of the Ascending Node (Ω)**: The angle from a reference direction to the ascending node, where the orbit crosses the reference plane.

By applying these parameters, our app can simulate the intricate movements of celestial bodies, allowing users to gain insights into their orbits and characteristics.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Engage with a stunning 3D representation of celestial bodies.
- **Dynamic Simulations**: Watch planets and asteroids move in real-time as you manipulate the simulation's controls.
- **Educational Content**: Discover information about each celestial body, including its orbit and classification.
- **User Controls**: Customize your experience with features like zoom, speed adjustments, and timeline controls.
- **Data-Driven**: Utilizes NASA's datasets to provide accurate and up-to-date orbital information.

## 📊 Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3**: Used for structuring and styling the web application, providing a responsive and visually appealing layout.
- **JavaScript**: The backbone of our interactive features and animations, allowing for real-time updates and user interaction.
- **Three.js**: A powerful 3D graphics library that enables the creation of the orrery's visual elements, making celestial bodies and their movements lifelike.
- **NASA API**: Accesses real-time data for celestial objects, ensuring that our visualizations are based on the latest scientific information.
- **Backend Framework**: (if applicable) A simple backend (e.g., Node.js) can be used to handle data requests and facilitate communication with the NASA API, though our app primarily relies on front-end technologies for real-time data fetching.
